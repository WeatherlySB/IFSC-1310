<h1>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h1>
<section class="essay">
   <p>
   The idea of web development being a built up process similar to the 
   cake analogy of structure, presentation, and behavior of a website
   was very helpful for understanding how the process of web development is expected to work.
   When learning about progressive enhancement and graceful degradation
   I noticed more when websites had either of these qualities or neither.
   As a developer, the process of building a website that includes progressive
   enhancements can be helpful in learning new skills. During this semester, 
   my understanding of the elements that make up a website have
   grown exponentially. With constant advances and changes in web development, I found it interesting
   to see how certain tags became "out of fashion" and were traded for CSS and JS advancements. 
   </p>
<p>
   From the experience of building the two different versions of the
   microsite, time management and proper planning were the two most important
   components of the development process. While working on my first microsite
   I made plans for parts of my website but didnt know what I wanted for my final product.
   In my second attempt I feel that I made a better effort to plan out my sections
   and the format of my home page.
   </p>
   <p>
   From this project I feel that I have learned more about what goes into the design
   of a website as well as the importance of website components that may seem small. 
   When recieving feed-back on my original design I had an issue with my margins pointed out.
   Feed-back like this was helpful in ensuring that my project for the next attempt was better 
   structured and more readable.
