  WHAT IS THE CENTAUR? <br/>
  Concept Centaur combines proprietary dynamic stabilization technology with advanced propulsion and suspension systems, 
  and an intuitive user interface to create a unique four-wheel device that is easily controllable on two or four wheels. 
  Its full suspension and aggressive rider positioning provide an exhilarating ride for one or two people while maintaining 
  control over a variety of terrain. Its rugged performance, zero emissions, and quiet operation make it a good low-impact 
  way to explore the world. Its power and versatility make it suitable for a variety of indoor and outdoor recreational and commercial applications.

Like the mythical half-horse, half-man of Greek lore, Concept Centaur combines the best of several technologies 
to create an innovative whole. The result of exploration by Segway Inc.'s product development team, Concept Centaur 
will challenge the way you think about four-wheeled transportation.

<section class="dev-info"> <p>
From time to time Segway's product development team devotes days, or even weeks, to creating new product concepts 
with the goal of finding a prince among frogs. It's a product exploration process they call "frog kissing." 
During this time, engineers and designers are encouraged to use any available materials in a very short time frame to prove a concept will work.
</p>
</section>

<section><p>
The product development team demonstrated that Concept Centaur was a princeâ€”a concept that passed this 
initial feasibility test, but is not yet ready to become a product. Concept Centaur demonstrates Segway's 
continued commitment to breakthrough innovation and the innumerable possibilities for the future of personal transportation.

Intuitive user controls: 

* Thumbs forward: The Centaur's forward and backward propulsion is easily controlled by pushing a 
thumb throttle located on the underside of the right-hand handlebar.

* Pop a wheelie: The Centaur uses dynamic stabilization technology to limit and/or maintain the angle 
at which the rider experiences the device. What would normally be a dangerous maneuver on a motorcycle or 
ATV becomes safe and controlled on the Centaur. In addition, the rider can position his/her body in three 
different ways, which makes for a fun ride. This technology also allows for a high-performance design with a short, 
compact wheelbase - a combination that traditionally can be very difficult to control.

* Lean forward, go forward: If you've haven't yet experienced the Segway PT, now is the time. If you have, 
you know what we mean by intuitive controls. Concept Centaur uses dynamic stabilization in a similar way. 
When on two wheels, the Centaur is controlled by how the rider shifts his or her weight. To go forward, 
lean forward. To go back, lean back. 

Simultaneous mechanical and drive-by-wire steering: 
* Smart steering: The front two wheels turn left and right mechanically, 
which is made possible by an innovative linkage system designed by Segway engineers. 
The Centaur's advanced controls software also allows the rear wheels to turn at different rates in 
response to data received from the rider's steering direction. When on two wheels, steering is accomplished 
in the same manner, by turning the handlebar. Sensors in the vertical portion of the steering column monitor 
the rider's input and sends a signal to the controller boards, which then issue a command to drive either or both of the rear wheels. 
Turning rate is coordinated so that even with the wheels off the ground, Centaur follows the path defined by the front wheel angles. 
This allows smooth transitions between two-wheel and four-wheel operation.
