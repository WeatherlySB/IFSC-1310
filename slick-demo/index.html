                            <h1>Now Showing Images of Stars</h1>
                            <p>Stars are the most widely recognized astronomical objects, 
                                and represent the most fundamental building blocks of galaxies. The age, distribution, 
                                and composition of the stars in a galaxy trace the history, dynamics, and evolution of that galaxy. 
                                Moreover, stars are responsible for the manufacture and distribution of heavy elements such as carbon, 
                                nitrogen, and oxygen, and their characteristics are intimately tied to the characteristics of the planetary 
                                systems that may coalesce about them. Consequently, the study of the birth, life, and death of stars is central 
                                to the field of astronomy.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Stars are born within the clouds of dust and scattered throughout most galaxies. 
                                A familiar example of such as a dust cloud is the Orion Nebula. Turbulence deep within these 
                                clouds gives rise to knots with sufficient mass that the gas and dust can begin to collapse 
                                under its own gravitational attraction. As the cloud collapses, the material at the center begins to heat up. 
                                Known as a protostar, it is this hot core at the heart of the collapsing cloud that will one day become a star. 
                                Three-dimensional computer models of star formation predict that the spinning clouds of collapsing gas and dust 
                                may break up into two or three blobs; this would explain why the majority the stars in the Milky Way are paired 
                                or in groups of multiple stars.

                        <li>The Archaeopteryx is the earliest known bird which lived approximately 147 million years ago. 
                            This bird was so different to todays birds. Not only did it have a long bony tail but it also had teeth!</li>
                        <li>The largest living bird in the world is the Ostrich, which can reach a height of up to 2.7 
                            metres with a wingspan of up to 2 metres (fairly impressive for a bird that can't fly). 
                            It will come as no surprise that the Ostrich also lays the largest bird eggs, weighing in at up to 1.5 kilograms.</li>
                        <li>There are numerous bird species all over the world. Typically, many scientists estimate the number 
                            of bird species to be about over 10,000. However, according to new research, there are about 18,000 bird species in the world!1
                            In the UK, the British Ornithologists Union (BOU) estimates that there are 628 species of birds. 
                            In the US, there are 1120 different species of birds. </li>
                       </ul>
