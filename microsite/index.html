    <h3>WHAT IS THE CENTAUR?</h3>
		<p>Concept Centaur combines proprietary dynamic stabilization technology with advanced propulsion and suspension systems, 
      and an intuitive user interface to create a unique four-wheel device that is easily controllable on two or four wheels. 
      Its full suspension and aggressive rider positioning provide an exhilarating ride for one or two people while maintaining 
      control over a variety of terrain. Its rugged performance, zero emissions, and quiet operation make it a good low-impact 
      way to explore the world. Its power and versatility make it suitable for a variety of indoor and outdoor recreational and commercial applications.

        <h1>CONCEPT CENTAUR</h1>
        
        <p>Like the mythical half-horse, half-man of Greek lore, Concept Centaur combines the best of several technologies to create 
          an innovative whole. The result of exploration by Segway Inc.'s product development team, Concept Centaur will challenge 
          the way you think about four-wheeled transportation. The Segway Centaur is quite a cool bit of design and when you add some 
          of Michelin's tweels instead of regular tires that is one-styling ATV. The centaur is not soon to be released, but working 
          pre-production units are out and about.During this time, 
          engineers and designers are encouraged to use any available materials in a very short time frame to prove a concept will work.</p>

            The product development team demonstrated that Concept Centaur was a princeâ€”a concept that passed this initial feasibility test, 
            but is not yet ready to become a product. Concept Centaur demonstrates Segway's continued commitment to breakthrough innovation 
            and the innumerable possibilities for the future of personal transportation.

          From time to time Segway's product development team devotes days, or even weeks, to creating new product concepts with 
          the goal of finding a prince among frogs. It's a product exploration process they call "frog kissing." During this time, 
          engineers and designers are encouraged to use any available materials in a very short time frame to prove a concept will work.
