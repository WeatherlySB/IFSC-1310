    <p>Gordo was one of the first monkeys to make it into space as part of NASA's space program. 
    Eight monkeys had flown on NASA missions before him, five of whom went by the name of Albert. 
    </p>
    
    <p>Gordo's historic flight took place on December 13, 1958 when he took off from Cape Canaveral for a 15 minute flight into space. 
    Even though he was weightless for over 8 minutes the on-board instruments indicated that Gordo enjoyed his journey into space. 
    Scientists monitoring the flight were pleased to note that the only slight side effect Gordo suffered from the entry into space was a <em>modest</em> slowing of his pulse.

    <h3>The Mission</h3>
    
    <p>The rocket carrying Gordo into space would take off from the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral, 
        travel further than any monkey had ever travelled before - over 1,500 miles - and reach a height of 310 miles 
        (500 km) before returning to Earth and landing in the South Atlantic, 1,302 nautical miles south of Cape Canaveral.

        we all heard the rumors that they want to send a monkey up first. Well, none of us wants to think that they're gonna
         send a monkey up to do a man's work. But what Gus is saying is that what they're trying to do to us is send a man up to do a monkey's work. 
         Us, a bunch of college-trained chimpanzees!

        Monkeys later flew on <strong>Aerobee rockets</strong>. On April 18, 1951, a monkey, possibly called Albert V, died due to parachute failure. 
        Yorick, also called Albert VI, along with 11 mouse crewmates, reached 236,000 ft (72 km, 44.7 mi) and survived the landing, 
        on September 20, 1951, the first monkey to do so (the dogs Dezik and Tsygan had survived a trip to space in July of that year), 
        although he died two hours later. Two of the mice also died after recovery; all of the deaths were thought to be related to stress 
        from overheating in the sealed capsule in the New Mexico sun while awaiting the recovery team.[2] Albert VI's flight surpassed the 
        50-mile boundary the U.S. used for spaceflight but was below the international definition of space. Patricia and Mike, two cynomolgus monkeys, 
        flew on May 21, 1952, and survived, but their flight was only to 26 kilometers. Sending monkeys to space would eventually allow humans to do so 
        and hear <q>that's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind</q> being spoken on TV.

    <p>The Jupiter IRBM (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile) was originally developed by the US Army as a long-range successor

    <h4>The Journey </h4>
    
    <p>Gordo wore a specially customised space suit custom made for a monkey about one foot tall. 
        The space suit was fitted with instruments, including temperature meters and microphones which recorded his historic suborbital journey, 
        considered one of the outstanding achievements of space research.
